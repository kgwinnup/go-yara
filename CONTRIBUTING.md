## How to contribute to go-yara

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/kgwinnup/go-yara/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/kgwinnup/go-yara/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Generally, I am open to PRs, but if you're intending to add substantial code, I ask that you contact me either through a GitHub issue or you can DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/switchp0rt).
